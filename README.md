# Kinda-ok JSON viewer

My own JSON viewer! It's gonna be kinda ok someday.

`npm start` / `npm test` / `npm run build`

There is probably a deployed version available at https://suspicious.website/ok

## Filter Syntax

Filter syntax will be important. For now, the following magic is available.

```
| Syntax    | Definition                                                     |
| ----------|----------------------------------------------------------------|
| <string>  | Search word to look for in *values*. Uses smartcase by default |
| \c        | force ignore case                                              |
| \C        | force match case                                               |
```
